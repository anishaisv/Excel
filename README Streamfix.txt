StreamFlix Dashboard Project
Objective
This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard using the StreamFlix dataset. The goal is to provide insights into user engagement and revenue trends through PivotTables, charts, and slicers.

Steps to Build the Dashboard

2. Create PivotTables
Total Watch Time by Genre: Sum of Watch Time, grouped by Genre.

Revenue by Subscription Type: Sum of Revenue, grouped by Subscription Type.

Watch Time by Country: Average Watch Time, grouped by Country and Subscription Type.

3. Add Visuals
Bar Chart: Total Watch Time by Genre.

Pie Chart: Revenue by Subscription Type.

Column Chart: Watch Time by Country.

4. Add Interactivity
Slicers: Add slicers for Genre and Country to filter data across PivotTables and charts.

5. Enhance Insights
Calculated Field: Average Revenue per Hour Watched.

Conditional Formatting: Highlight watch times above 20 hours in green and revenues below Â£25 in red.

6. Polish the Dashboard
Arrange all elements neatly on a single sheet.

Add a clear title and labels for charts and PivotTables.

Include a note specifying the latest data update.

7. Save and Test
Test slicers for functionality.

Save the completed dashboard.
